### Option 2: Local Server with PM2
**Best for: Users with dedicated hardware**

```bash
# Run the deployment script
./deploy.sh  # Linux/Mac
# OR
.\deploy.ps1  # Windows
```

### Option 3: Docker Deployment
**Best for: Advanced users, consistent environments**

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t trading-signal-system .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name trading-signal-system trading-signal-system
```

## üîß Local 24/7 Setup (Windows)

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites
1. Install Node.js 16+ from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Open PowerShell as Administrator

### Step 2: Deploy with PM2
```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\david\OneDrive\Documents\Trading Signal 2"

# Run the deployment script
.\deploy.ps1
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```powershell
# Check if the system is running
pm2 list

# View logs
pm2 logs trading-signal-system

# Monitor in real-time
pm2 monit
```

## üåê Cloud Deployment Steps

### Railway Deployment
1. **Prepare Repository**

   - Verify `package.json` and `Procfile` exist

2. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your trading signal repository
   - Railway automatically detects Node.js and deploys

3. **Get Your URL**
   - Railway provides a public URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
   - Your system is now running 24/7 globally

### Render Deployment
1. **Create Account**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Create Web Service**
   - Click "New" ‚Üí "Web Service"

     - **Start Command**: `npm start`
     - **Plan**: Free (or paid for more resources)

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Render builds and deploys automatically
   - Get your public URL

## üìä Monitoring Your 24/7 System

### Local Monitoring (PM2)
```bash
# View all processes
pm2 list

# Monitor CPU/Memory usage
pm2 monit

# View real-time logs
pm2 logs trading-signal-system

# Check application status
pm2 show trading-signal-system
```

### Cloud Platform Monitoring
- **Railway**: Dashboard shows logs, metrics, and status
- **Render**: Service dashboard with health checks
- **Heroku**: Logs and metrics in dashboard

### Health Checks
Your system includes automatic health checks:
- Application responds to `/api/assets` endpoint
- PM2 automatically restarts on crashes
- Docker health checks ensure container health

## üîÑ Automatic Restart Features

### PM2 Process Management
- **Auto-restart**: Automatically restarts crashed applications
- **Startup script**: Runs on system boot
- **Memory limits**: Restarts if memory usage exceeds 1GB
- **Crash detection**: Monitors and restarts failed processes

### Docker Features
- **Restart policy**: `unless-stopped` ensures container restarts
- **Health checks**: Monitors application health every 30 seconds
- **Resource limits**: Prevents memory leaks

### Cloud Platform Features
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes
- **Load balancing**: Distributes requests
- **Uptime monitoring**: Alerts on downtime

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting 24/7 Operation

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
```bash
# Check logs
pm2 logs trading-signal-system

# Restart application
pm2 restart trading-signal-system

# Check Node.js version
node --version
```

**Memory issues:**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
pm2 monit

# Restart if needed
pm2 restart trading-signal-system
```

**Network connectivity:**
- Check firewall settings
- Verify port 3000 is open
- Test with `curl http://localhost:3000/api/assets`

### Recovery Commands
```bash
# Full restart
pm2 stop trading-signal-system
pm2 delete trading-signal-system
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
pm2 save

# Docker restart
docker-compose restart

# Cloud platform restart
# Use platform dashboard to restart service
```
